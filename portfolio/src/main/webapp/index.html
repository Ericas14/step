      <p>My primary programming language is Java but I've also had exposure to Python and C++. 
          My most interesting and difficult project I've done in Java is a project called MadLibs.
          It was essentially a computer version of the written game of the same name. In this
          project, I had to read a file, look for placeholders within the file, prompt the user
          for a corresponding noun, verb, adjective, etc., and then rewrite the file with the
          user's answers. The user could also view their MadLib, previous MadLibs, and create another,
          in the same run. </p>

    <p>My largest project I've done in Python is called The Labyrinth. This project can be found in
        my Github under the name "Maze_Project". This project was completed by me and two other people
        Google CSSI.I was in charge of making the level-1 maze and making the sprite move throughout 
        the maze. The maze was created using a 2D array of images. The sprite could move through the maze
        by looking at the next image and seeing if it was "empty" or a "wall". The game also required the
        user to retreive a key before being able to complete the level. </p>
